This player lineup calculator is for NWBA teams. 

You can select 5 players, each assigned a point value reflecting their functional ability. The NWBA classifies players from 1.0 to 4.5 points, with lower numbers indicating greater impairment and higher numbers indicating less. By selecting each player and viewing their point values, you can quickly determine the total points on the court. This helps ensure your lineup complies with NWBA rules, which vary by division. Please refer to the specific division rules for point limits.
